## Code of conduct

The team members and the project's community adopts an inclusive Code of Conduct that you can read in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT_EN.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT_EN.md) file.

## Report an issue

The prefered way to report any bug is [opening an issue in the project's Github repo](https://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona/decidim-barcelona/issues/new).

For more informal communication, contact team members via twitter

## Resolve an issue

Admins tag issues using two label related with collaboration availability:

* `PRs-welcome`: [issues labeled with PRs-welcome](https://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona/decidim-barcelona/labels/PRs-welcome) are well defined features ready to be implemented by whoever wants to do it.

* `Not-ready`: with this label admins mark features or changes that are not well defined yet or subject to an internal decision. Is not a good idea to start implementation of these issues.

If you want to contribute code to solve an issue:

* Add a comment to tell everyone you are working on the issue.
* If an issue has someone assigned it means that person is already working on it.
* Fork the project.
* Create a topic branch based on master.
* Commit there your code to solve the issue.
* Make sure all test are passing (and add specs to test any new feature if needed).
* Follow these [best practices](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby)
* Open a *pull request* to the main repository describing what issue you are addressing.

## Other ways of contributing without coding

* If you think there's a feature missing, or find a bug, create an issue (make sure it has not already been reported).
* You can also help promoting the project talking about it in your social networks.

## How to report an issue

* Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title
* Is a good idea to include some of there sections:
  * Steps to reproduce the bug
  * Expected behaviour/response
  * Actual response
* Sometimes it is also helpful if you mention your operating system, browser version and installed plugins.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
